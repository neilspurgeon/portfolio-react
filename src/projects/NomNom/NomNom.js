        <p>In 2017 Hathway was planning to build a handful of functionally similar apps in the fast casual and quick service restaurant space. Having recently launched apps for both Jamba Juice and The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, we knew there were a lot of inneficnies and repetive problem solving that could be reduced, all while creating a better value for the client and increasing the agencyâ€™s margins.</p>

        <p>Our goal was to create a base app with proven ux that could be easily themed and demoed to clients. From there we could take the themed base app and decide on the level of customization from there.</p>

        <h3 className={shared.sectionHeader}>Core Features</h3>
        <p>After client working sessions and competitive analysis, we decided on four primary sections of the app and identififed common features that we deemed should be standard.</p>
