        <h3 className={shared.sectionHeader}>Problem</h3>

        <p>While updating their brand and working through the release of a mobile ordering and rewards app,  The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf also decided it was time update their website. While already having an ecommerce website, it posed many usability issues and also performed very low in SEO rankings mainly due to not being mobile responsive and an overall lack of content.</p>

        <p>Not only were we looking to fix existing problems, but our team at Hathway also identified many additional features to better meet the user needs, and ultimatley increase sales. This included seamlessly integrating user accounts across the mobile app and website, allowing them to manage their account from either platform.</p>

      <ProjectText>
        <h3 className={shared.sectionHeader}>Process</h3>

        <p>With only very limited analytics history, we had to base most of our deciscions on ecommerce and SEO best practices, and then learn and improve from there. This was done both by user testing in the protoype and wireframing stages, as well looking at real data once the first iteration was launched.</p>

        <p>We started the design process by creating a high level site map and then moving in to various degrees of detailed wireframing. This allowed us to identify and test potential problems early on, as well as getting stakeholder approval without as many visual distractions.</p>
