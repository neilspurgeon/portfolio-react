      <p>I’m currently in the first stage of this project where I’ve been designing and developing a sort-of web font playground that will be used as the foundation going forward. To get things started I created a database that stores about 40 curated Google fonts and will then be added to as the project evolves. Right now, the user can then generate random font combinations from the database and then save them to their own collection for later reference. </p>

      <p>The next stage will be to create a database of curated combinations instead of randomly selected ones. I want users to be able to submit what they come up with, have it go through an approval process, and then get added to the database. It could then naturally grow from there.</p>
